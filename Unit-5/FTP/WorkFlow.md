To demonstrate how the basic model of the **FTP mechanism** would work in a real-time file transfer system, let's break it down into the **steps** of communication between the **FTP client** and the **FTP server** using a typical **FTP session**:

### Key Components Involved:
- **FTP Client**: A user (or software) that connects to the FTP server to send commands and receive files.
- **FTP Server**: The machine that hosts the files and provides access to clients.
- **Control Connection**: Used for sending commands and receiving responses.
- **Data Connection**: Used for transferring files and directory listings.

### Step-by-Step FTP Process for Real-Time File Transfer:

---

### **Step 1: Establishing a Control Connection**
- The **FTP client** initiates a connection to the **FTP server**.
- **FTP client** connects to the server's default port 21 (the control port) using the **control connection**.

**Example**:
1. **Client**: Initiates connection to the server at **ftp.example.com** using port 21.
2. **Server**: Listens on port 21 and responds with a **220 Service ready** message.

---

### **Step 2: Client Sends Authentication Commands (USER & PASS)**
- The **FTP client** sends the **USER** command with the username to the server to initiate authentication.
- The **FTP server** responds with a message asking for the password (e.g., **331 Username okay, need password**).
- The **FTP client** sends the **PASS** command with the password.
- The **FTP server** confirms the login with a **230 User logged in, proceed** message.

**Example**:
1. **Client**: Sends **USER username** to the server.
2. **Server**: Responds with **331 User name okay, need password**.
3. **Client**: Sends **PASS password**.
4. **Server**: Responds with **230 User logged in, proceed**.

---

### **Step 3: Sending FTP Commands (LIST, CWD, etc.)**
- After successful authentication, the **FTP client** can send commands to interact with the files on the server.
- **Client** might use the **LIST** command to list files in the current directory.
- **FTP server** will respond with a list of files or directories.

**Example**:
1. **Client**: Sends **LIST** to list the files in the current directory.
2. **Server**: Responds with a list of files, e.g., `file1.txt`, `file2.pdf`.

---

### **Step 4: Initiating File Transfer (RETR or STOR)**
- When the **FTP client** wants to download (retrieve) or upload (store) a file, it will use the **RETR** (for download) or **STOR** (for upload) command.

#### **File Download (RETR) Process:**
- The **FTP client** sends the **RETR** command to request the file.
- The **FTP server** opens a **data connection** to transfer the file's content.

  - **Active Mode**: In Active FTP, the client provides a port number where it will receive the data, and the server connects to that port.
  - **Passive Mode**: In Passive FTP, the server opens a port, and the client connects to it to receive the data.

- The **data connection** is used solely for transferring the file.

**Example**:
1. **Client**: Sends **RETR file1.txt** to download the file.
2. **Server**: Opens a **data connection** and begins sending the file data (e.g., the content of `file1.txt`).
3. **Client**: Receives the file over the data connection.
4. **Server**: Sends a **226 Transfer complete** message after the file is fully transferred.

#### **File Upload (STOR) Process:**
- The **FTP client** sends the **STOR** command to upload the file.
- Similar to **RETR**, the **data connection** is opened, and the client starts sending the file data.

**Example**:
1. **Client**: Sends **STOR file2.txt** to upload the file.
2. **Server**: Opens a **data connection** and starts receiving the file data from the client.
3. **Client**: Sends the file content over the data connection.
4. **Server**: Sends a **226 Transfer complete** message after the file is uploaded successfully.

---

### **Step 5: Closing the Connection**
- Once all required operations (such as file transfers or directory listings) are complete, the **FTP client** can close the connection by sending the **QUIT** command.
- The **FTP server** responds with a **221 Service closing control connection** message, indicating that the control connection is now closed.

**Example**:
1. **Client**: Sends **QUIT** to close the session.
2. **Server**: Responds with **221 Service closing control connection**.

The session is now terminated.

### Real-Time Example Scenario:

1. **FTP Client** (e.g., FileZilla or command-line client) wants to download a file, say **photo.jpg**, from an FTP server.
2. The **client** connects to the **FTP server** (using port 21).
3. The **server** welcomes the client with a **220** message.
4. The **client** logs in using **USER** and **PASS** commands.
5. The **client** sends **LIST** to see the available files.
6. The **client** sends **RETR photo.jpg** to download the file.
7. The **server** establishes a **data connection** and sends the file contents over it.
8. After the transfer is complete, the **server** closes the data connection.
9. Finally, the **client** sends **QUIT** to close the session, and the **server** responds with **221**.
