### 🧠 Summary in Real-Life Terms

It’s like:

1. Walking into a post office (connect).
2. Saying hello and showing ID (greeting).
3. Writing your name on the letter (MAIL FROM).
4. Addressing the letter (RCPT TO).
5. Writing and handing over the letter (DATA + message + `.`).
6. Saying thanks and leaving (QUIT).
