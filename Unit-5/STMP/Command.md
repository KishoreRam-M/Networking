### 📬 **SMTP Email Delivery Process: Step by Step**

---

### **🔹 Step 1: HELO or EHLO – "Say Hello!"**

📨 **Command:**
```plaintext
HELO client.example.com
```
or
```plaintext
EHLO client.example.com
```

✅ **Purpose:**  
The email client (your email app or service) introduces itself to the mail server.  
**Analogy:** You walk into the post office and say, *"Hi, I'm from Client.com."*

---

### **🔹 Step 2: MAIL FROM – "Who's sending the mail?"**

📨 **Command:**
```plaintext
MAIL FROM:<alice@example.com>
```

✅ **Purpose:**  
Specifies the sender’s email address (the “return address”).  
**Analogy:** You write your name and address on the envelope.

---

### **🔹 Step 3: RCPT TO – "Who's receiving the mail?"**

📨 **Command:**
```plaintext
RCPT TO:<bob@example.com>
```

✅ **Purpose:**  
Tells the server who the recipient is. You can use this command multiple times to send the same email to several people.  
**Analogy:** You write the recipient’s address on the envelope. Want to send it to 3 people? Write 3 addresses.

---

### **🔹 Step 4: DATA – "Here’s the content of the email"**

📨 **Command:**
```plaintext
DATA
```

📨 **Followed by:**
```
From: alice@example.com
To: bob@example.com
Subject: Hello from SMTP!

Hi Bob,
This is a test email.
Regards,
Alice
.
```

✅ **Purpose:**  
After this command, the client sends:
- The **email headers** (From, To, Subject, etc.)
- A **blank line**
- Then the **email body** (the actual message)
- Finally, a **single period on a line by itself (`.`)** to mark the end of the message.

**Analogy:** You give the post office the full letter: the envelope info (headers) and the letter inside (body). A period means "I’m done."

---

### **🔹 Step 5: QUIT – "Goodbye!"**

📨 **Command:**
```plaintext
QUIT
```

✅ **Purpose:**  
Ends the session and disconnects the client from the mail server.

**Analogy:** You wave goodbye and leave the post office after mailing your letter.
