Sure! Let’s break down that **practical example of sending an email** into an easy-to-follow story. Think of it like sending a physical letter from your home to someone else in another city, but all done digitally using **SMTP, POP3, and IMAP**.

### 📧 Step-by-Step Story of Sending an Email

---

#### ✅ **1. Composing the Email**

You write an email in Outlook, Gmail, Thunderbird, etc.  
Example:  
- **From**: alice@example.com  
- **To**: bob@anothermail.com  
- **Subject**: Hello Bob  
- **Body**: "Hope you're doing great!"

You click **“Send.”**

---

#### 🔌 **2. Connecting to SMTP Server (Your Outgoing Mailman)**

Your email client connects to your **SMTP server** (like `smtp.example.com`) — this is like giving the letter to your local post office.

- **Connection opens**
- Client says:  
  ➤ `EHLO your-computer.local`

---

#### 📬 **3. Telling Who It's From and To**

Your client sends:

- ➤ `MAIL FROM:<alice@example.com>`  
  *(“I’m sending this email from Alice”)*
- ➤ `RCPT TO:<bob@anothermail.com>`  
  *(“It’s for Bob”)*
  
The SMTP server responds:  
✔️ “Okay, I know where to send it.”

---

#### 📝 **4. Sending the Email Content**

Client sends:
- ➤ `DATA`  
  *(“Here comes the actual message”)*  
- Then the headers + body:
  ```
  From: alice@example.com
  To: bob@anothermail.com
  Subject: Hello Bob

  Hope you're doing great!
  .
  ```
- The period (`.`) tells the server, "Done sending!"

Server responds:  
✔️ “Message received. I’ll deliver it.”

---

#### 📦 **5. Relaying the Email (If Needed)**

The SMTP server might **pass the email along through one or more other SMTP servers** (called relays) until it reaches the **recipient’s mail server** (like `mail.anothermail.com`).

---

#### 📥 **6. Recipient’s Mail Server Stores the Email**

The final mail server stores Bob’s email in his **mailbox** (like putting it in his postbox).

---

#### 📤 **7. Bob Checks His Inbox (Using POP3 or IMAP)**

- If Bob uses **POP3**: He downloads the email to his device and it’s usually deleted from the server.
- If Bob uses **IMAP**: The email stays on the server and syncs with all of Bob's devices.

Bob opens his email client and sees:  
🗨️ "Hello Bob – Hope you're doing great!"
