### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Non-Persistent Connections (Old School)**

In the old days, when using **HTTP/1.0**, every time a browser or client wanted to get something from a server (like a webpage, image, etc.), it would:
- **Open a new connection** to the server
- **Send the request**
- **Get the response**
- **Close the connection** after receiving the data.

So, if you wanted 10 things from the server (e.g., a webpage, 3 images, 2 CSS files, etc.), it would **open and close 10 separate connections**! This is **non-persistent** because the connection is not kept open.

#### The problem:
- Every time a new connection is made, it takes time to establish and close.
- This **slows down performance** because of the constant overhead of opening and closing connections.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Persistent Connections (More Efficient)**

With **HTTP/1.1** (the modern version of HTTP), things got better. Instead of opening and closing a new connection for each request, the connection stays **open** for multiple requests.

This is called a **persistent connection** or **keep-alive**. In simple terms:
- The connection is **kept open** after the first request, and you can send multiple requests over that same connection without needing to reopen it each time.

For example, if you need 10 things from the server, the browser opens **1 connection** and gets all 10 items without closing it in between. This saves time and makes things faster.

#### The benefit:
- **Faster performance** because the server doesn‚Äôt have to keep opening and closing connections.

### Key Differences:

| **Persistent Connections** (HTTP/1.1) | **Non-Persistent Connections** (HTTP/1.0) |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Keeps the connection **open** for multiple requests | Opens a **new connection** for each request |
| **Faster** because no need to open/close for every request | Slower due to repeated **connection setup** |
| **Default** behavior in HTTP/1.1 | Used in **HTTP/1.0**, but can still be used today |

---

### Summary:
- **Non-persistent** = **Open a new connection for each request**. Slower.
- **Persistent** = **Keep the connection open** for multiple requests. Faster.
