### ✅ The Simple Rule:
👉 **A blank line means: “Headers are done. Body starts now.”**

That blank line is just a special character combo:  
```
\r\n\r\n
```
This means:
- `\r\n` = End of one header line
- Two of them (`\r\n\r\n`) = End of all headers

---

### 📦 Example:

```http
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 48

{
  "username": "john",
  "password": "secret"
}
```

Here’s what’s happening:
1. Every header line ends with `\r\n`
2. After the last header, there's **one more `\r\n`** — that’s the **blank line**
3. What follows is the **body** (`{ "username": ... }`)

---

### 🚦 How Server Understands:
- Server reads line by line.
- When it sees a **blank line** (`\r\n\r\n`), it knows:
  > “Okay, no more headers. Everything after this is the body.”

---

### 🧪 Visual Flow:

```
Header 1\r\n
Header 2\r\n
Header 3\r\n
\r\n          ← this empty line tells server: headers are done
Body starts here...
```
