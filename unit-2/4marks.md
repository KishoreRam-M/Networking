# Data Link Layer & Network Access - Complete Answers

## 1. Do we need a multiple access protocol when using the local loop of the telephone company to access the Internet? Give reason? (CO2.1 K2)

*Answer: NO, we do not need a multiple access protocol when using the local loop.*

*Reasons:*
- The local loop is a *dedicated point-to-point connection* between a subscriber's premises and the telephone company's central office
- It provides *exclusive access* to a single user at any given time
- There is *no sharing of the medium* with other users simultaneously
- Multiple access protocols are only needed when *multiple users share the same communication medium*
- Examples where multiple access is NOT needed: DSL, dial-up connections using local loop
- Examples where multiple access IS needed: Ethernet LAN, WiFi, cellular networks

## 2. In a pure Aloha network with G = 1/2, how is the throughput affected in each case? (CO2.1 K3)

*Pure ALOHA Throughput Formula: S = G × e^(-2G)*

*Given: G = 1/2 = 0.5*
*Initial Throughput: S = 0.5 × e^(-2×0.5) = 0.5 × e^(-1) = 0.5 × 0.368 = 0.184*

### a. G is increased to 1:
- *New Throughput: S = 1 × e^(-2×1) = 1 × e^(-2) = 1 × 0.135 = 0.135*
- *Effect: Throughput DECREASES from 0.184 to 0.135*
- *Reason: Higher G means more collisions, reducing effective throughput*

### b. G is decreased to 1/4:
- *New Throughput: S = 0.25 × e^(-2×0.25) = 0.25 × e^(-0.5) = 0.25 × 0.606 = 0.152*
- *Effect: Throughput DECREASES from 0.184 to 0.152*
- *Reason: Lower G means less channel utilization*

*Key Point: Maximum throughput occurs at G = 0.5, which is 0.184 or 18.4%*

#### *Receiver Side:*
1. *Frame Reception* - Receive and check frame
2. *Error Detection* - Verify checksum
3. *Acknowledgment* - Send ACK if frame is correct
4. *NAK Sending* - Send negative ACK if error detected

### *Advantages:*
- *Simple implementation* - Easy to understand and code
- *Reliable delivery* - Ensures all frames are received
- *Error recovery* - Automatic retransmission on errors
- *Flow control* - Prevents receiver buffer overflow

## 15. Demonstrate how an ARP query is sent within a broadcast frame (CO2.9 K2)

### *ARP Query Process:*

#### *Scenario:* Host A (192.168.1.10) wants to communicate with Host B (192.168.1.20) but doesn't know B's MAC address.

### *Step-by-Step Process:*

#### *Step 1: ARP Request Generation*

ARP Request Packet:
- Hardware Type: Ethernet (1)
- Protocol Type: IPv4 (0x0800)
- Hardware Length: 6 bytes
- Protocol Length: 4 bytes
- Operation: Request (1)
- Sender MAC: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF (Host A's MAC)
- Sender IP: 192.168.1.10
- Target MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:00 (Unknown)
- Target IP: 192.168.1.20


#### *Step 2: Ethernet Frame Creation*

Ethernet Frame:
+------------------+------------------+------+----------+-----+
| Dest MAC         | Source MAC       | Type | ARP Data | FCS |
| FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF| AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF| 0806 |   ...    | ... |
+------------------+------------------+------+----------+-----+
   (Broadcast)         (Host A)        (ARP)


#### *Step 3: Broadcast Transmission*
- *Destination MAC:* FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (Broadcast)
- *All hosts* on the local network receive the frame
- *Switches flood* the frame to all ports
- *Only Host B* processes the ARP request (IP match)

#### *Step 4: ARP Reply*

Host B responds with:
- Target MAC: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF (Host A)
- Sender MAC: 11:22:33:44:55:66 (Host B's MAC)
- Operation: Reply (2)


#### *Step 5: ARP Table Update*

Host A's ARP Table:
IP Address      MAC Address         Interface
192.168.1.20    11:22:33:44:55:66   eth0


### *Key Points:*
- *Broadcast ensures* all hosts receive the query
- *Only target host* responds to the ARP request
- *ARP tables* are updated for future communications
- *Reduces network traffic* by caching MAC addresses
