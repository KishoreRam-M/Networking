# Complete Networking Study Guide - IPv4, IPv6, and Routing Protocols

## Part 1: IPv4 Fundamentals

### 1. Structure of IPv4 Address

**What is an IPv4 Address?**
An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a device on a network. It's written as four numbers separated by dots.

**Structure:**
- 32 bits total = 4 bytes = 4 octets
- Each octet = 8 bits (0-255)
- Format: A.B.C.D (example: 192.168.1.1)

**Example:**
```
IP Address: 192.168.1.100
Binary:     11000000.10101000.00000001.01100100
```

**Parts of IPv4 Address:**
- **Network Part**: Identifies the network
- **Host Part**: Identifies the specific device

### 2. IPv4 Address Classes

IPv4 addresses are divided into classes based on their first octet:

| Class | Range | Default Subnet Mask | Network Bits | Host Bits | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| A | 1-126 | 255.0.0.0 (/8) | 8 | 24 | Large networks |
| B | 128-191 | 255.255.0.0 (/16) | 16 | 16 | Medium networks |
| C | 192-223 | 255.255.255.0 (/24) | 24 | 8 | Small networks |
| D | 224-239 | N/A | N/A | N/A | Multicast |
| E | 240-255 | N/A | N/A | N/A | Experimental |

**Examples:**
- Class A: 10.0.0.1 (can have 16 million hosts)
- Class B: 172.16.0.1 (can have 65,000 hosts)
- Class C: 192.168.1.1 (can have 254 hosts)

### 3. Public vs Private IPv4 Addresses

**Public Addresses:**
- Globally unique
- Routable on the internet
- Assigned by ISPs
- Examples: 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS), 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare DNS)

**Private Addresses (RFC 1918):**
- Used within private networks
- Not routable on the internet
- Can be reused in different private networks

**Private Address Ranges:**
- Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
- Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
- Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

**Why Use Private Addresses?**
- Conserve public IP addresses
- Provide security (hidden from internet)
- Cost-effective

### 4. Subnetting in IPv4

**What is Subnetting?**
Subnetting divides a large network into smaller, manageable sub-networks.

**Why Use Subnetting?**
- Efficient use of IP addresses
- Improved network performance
- Enhanced security
- Better network management
- Reduced broadcast traffic

**Example:**
```
Original Network: 192.168.1.0/24 (256 addresses)
Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0/26 (64 addresses)
Subnet 2: 192.168.1.64/26 (64 addresses)
Subnet 3: 192.168.1.128/26 (64 addresses)
Subnet 4: 192.168.1.192/26 (64 addresses)
```

### 5. Types of Communication in IPv4

**Unicast:**
- One-to-one communication
- Single sender to single receiver
- Example: Web browsing, email
- Most common type of communication

**Multicast:**
- One-to-many communication
- Single sender to multiple specific receivers
- Uses Class D addresses (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255)
- Example: Video streaming, online gaming

**Broadcast:**
- One-to-all communication
- Single sender to all devices in network
- Example: DHCP requests, ARP requests
- Limited to local network segment

## Part 2: IPv6 Fundamentals

### 6. IPv6 vs IPv4 Comparison

| Feature | IPv4 | IPv6 |
|---------|------|------|
| Address Length | 32 bits | 128 bits |
| Address Format | 192.168.1.1 | 2001:db8::1 |
| Address Space | 4.3 billion | 340 undecillion |
| Security | Optional (IPSec) | Built-in (IPSec) |
| Header Size | 20-60 bytes | 40 bytes (fixed) |
| Checksum | Yes | No |
| Fragmentation | Router & Host | Host only |
| Auto-configuration | DHCP | SLAAC + DHCP |

### 7. IPv6 Header Format

**IPv6 Header Structure (40 bytes fixed):**

```
|Version|Traffic Class|Flow Label    |
|Payload Length    |Next Header|Hop Limit|
|Source Address (128 bits)            |
|Destination Address (128 bits)       |
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- **Version (4 bits)**: Always 6 for IPv6
- **Traffic Class (8 bits)**: QoS priority
- **Flow Label (20 bits)**: Identifies packet flows
- **Payload Length (16 bits)**: Size of data
- **Next Header (8 bits)**: Protocol type
- **Hop Limit (8 bits)**: TTL equivalent
- **Source/Destination (128 bits each)**: Addresses

**Key Differences from IPv4:**
- Fixed header size (simpler processing)
- No checksum (faster processing)
- No fragmentation by routers
- Built-in security features

## Part 3: Routing Protocols

### 8. Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

**What is RIP?**
RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol that uses hop count as its metric.

**Working Principle:**
1. Each router maintains a routing table
2. Routers exchange tables with neighbors every 30 seconds
3. Best path = path with lowest hop count
4. Maximum hop count = 15 (16 = unreachable)

**RIP Process:**
```
Step 1: Router learns directly connected networks
Step 2: Router shares its table with neighbors
Step 3: Router receives updates from neighbors
Step 4: Router updates its table with better routes
Step 5: Process repeats every 30 seconds
```

**Limitations of RIP:**
- Maximum 15 hops (small networks only)
- Slow convergence (up to several minutes)
- Periodic updates waste bandwidth
- Only considers hop count (ignores bandwidth, delay)
- Vulnerable to routing loops

### 9. Distance Vector vs Link-State Routing

**Distance Vector Routing:**
- **Principle**: "Routing by rumor"
- **Information**: Distance and direction to destinations
- **Updates**: Periodic, sent to neighbors only
- **Algorithm**: Bellman-Ford
- **Examples**: RIP, EIGRP
- **Convergence**: Slow
- **Scalability**: Limited

**Link-State Routing:**
- **Principle**: "Complete network map"
- **Information**: Complete network topology
- **Updates**: Event-triggered, flooded to all routers
- **Algorithm**: Dijkstra's Shortest Path First
- **Examples**: OSPF, IS-IS
- **Convergence**: Fast
- **Scalability**: Better

### 10. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

**How OSPF Overcomes RIP Limitations:**

| RIP Problem | OSPF Solution |
|-------------|---------------|
| 15-hop limit | No hop limit |
| Slow convergence | Fast convergence |
| Periodic updates | Event-triggered updates |
| Simple metric | Multiple metrics (cost, bandwidth) |
| Routing loops | Loop-free topology database |

**OSPF Features:**
- Uses link-state algorithm
- Maintains complete network topology
- Calculates shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Supports multiple equal-cost paths
- Hierarchical design with areas

### 11. Dijkstra's Algorithm in OSPF

**Purpose:**
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from source to all destinations in a network.

**How it Works:**
1. Start with source node
2. Calculate distance to all directly connected neighbors
3. Select node with shortest distance
4. Update distances through this node
5. Repeat until all nodes are processed

**Example:**
```
Network: A--2--B--3--C
         |     |
         4     1
         |     |
         D--1--E

From A to C:
Path 1: A→B→C = 2+3 = 5
Path 2: A→D→E→B→C = 4+1+1+3 = 9
Best path: A→B→C (cost = 5)
```

**Significance in OSPF:**
- Ensures loop-free paths
- Finds optimal routes based on cost
- Provides fast convergence
- Supports load balancing across equal-cost paths

## Part 4: Advanced Routing Concepts

### 12. Autonomous Systems (AS)

**What is an Autonomous System?**
An AS is a collection of networks under a single administrative control that shares a common routing policy.

**Characteristics:**
- Single routing policy
- Common administration
- Unique AS number (ASN)
- Can contain multiple networks

**Examples:**
- Internet Service Provider networks
- Large corporate networks
- University networks
- Government networks

**AS Numbers:**
- 16-bit: 1-65535 (original)
- 32-bit: 65536-4294967295 (new)
- Private: 64512-65534 (for private use)

### 13. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

**What is BGP?**
BGP is the protocol that routes traffic between different autonomous systems on the Internet.

**Purpose:**
- Inter-domain routing (between different ASes)
- Internet's core routing protocol
- Maintains routing between ISPs
- Ensures global Internet connectivity

**Main Components of BGP:**

**1. BGP Speakers:**
- Routers that run BGP protocol
- Exchange routing information
- Make routing decisions

**2. BGP Sessions:**
- TCP connections between BGP speakers
- Port 179
- Reliable message exchange

**3. BGP Attributes:**
- AS_PATH: List of ASes the route has traversed
- NEXT_HOP: Next router to reach destination
- LOCAL_PREF: Preference within AS
- MED: Metric for external comparison

**4. BGP Messages:**
- OPEN: Establish BGP session
- UPDATE: Advertise/withdraw routes
- KEEPALIVE: Maintain session
- NOTIFICATION: Report errors

**How BGP Works:**
1. BGP speakers establish TCP sessions
2. Exchange routing tables
3. Select best paths using attributes
4. Advertise best paths to neighbors
5. Monitor and update routes as needed

## Part 5: Multicast Routing

### 14. Multicast Routing Concept

**What is Multicast Routing?**
Multicast routing efficiently delivers data from one sender to multiple receivers simultaneously.

**Advantages:**
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Single transmission for multiple receivers
- **Scalability**: Doesn't increase with number of receivers
- **Resource Conservation**: Reduces network load
- **Cost Effective**: Less infrastructure needed
- **Real-time Applications**: Ideal for live streaming

**Challenges:**
- **Complexity**: More complex than unicast routing
- **State Management**: Routers must maintain group membership
- **Scalability Issues**: State information grows with groups
- **Reliability**: No built-in acknowledgment mechanism
- **Security**: Difficult to secure multicast traffic
- **Firewall Issues**: Many firewalls block multicast

### 15. Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP)

**What is DVMRP?**
DVMRP is one of the first multicast routing protocols, based on RIP with multicast extensions.

**Working Principle:**
1. **Flood and Prune**: Initially floods multicast traffic everywhere
2. **Pruning**: Removes branches with no interested receivers
3. **Grafting**: Adds branches when new receivers join
4. **Reverse Path Forwarding**: Uses reverse path to prevent loops

**DVMRP Process:**
```
Step 1: Build shortest-path tree from source
Step 2: Forward multicast packets along tree
Step 3: Prune branches with no receivers
Step 4: Periodically refresh pruned branches
Step 5: Graft new branches when receivers join
```

### 16. Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)

**What is PIM?**
PIM is a modern multicast routing protocol that works with any unicast routing protocol.

**Significance:**
- Protocol independent (works with OSPF, RIP, BGP, etc.)
- More efficient than DVMRP
- Two modes: Dense Mode and Sparse Mode
- Widely deployed in modern networks

**PIM Dense Mode:**
- Assumes receivers are densely distributed
- Floods initially, then prunes
- Good for small networks with many receivers

**PIM Sparse Mode:**
- Assumes receivers are sparsely distributed
- Uses rendezvous points (RP)
- Explicit join process
- More scalable for large networks

### 17. DVMRP vs PIM Comparison

| Feature | DVMRP | PIM |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Dependency** | Requires distance-vector routing | Protocol independent |
| **Initial Approach** | Flood and prune | Explicit join (Sparse) or flood and prune (Dense) |
| **Scalability** | Limited | Better |
| **Efficiency** | Less efficient | More efficient |
| **Complexity** | Simpler | More complex |
| **Deployment** | Older networks | Modern networks |
| **State Management** | Per-source state | Shared tree state |
| **Convergence** | Slower | Faster |

**DVMRP Working:**
- Builds source-based distribution trees
- Floods multicast traffic initially
- Prunes unnecessary branches
- Maintains per-source state

**PIM Working:**
- Can use shared trees (Sparse Mode) or source trees (Dense Mode)
- More efficient join/leave mechanisms
- Better scalability through rendezvous points
- Protocol-independent design
